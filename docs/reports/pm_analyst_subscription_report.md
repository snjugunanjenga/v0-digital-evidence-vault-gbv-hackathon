# PM & Analyst Report: Organizational Contracts and Subscription Models

**Date:** December 6, 2025

## Overview
This report summarizes key considerations for organizational contracts and subscription models for SaaS legal technology designed to support Gender-Based Violence (GBV) survivors. The primary focus is on prioritizing safety, ethics, data protection, and sustainability, while acknowledging the unique vulnerabilities of GBV survivors and the operational realities of support organizations.

## Organizational Contracts: Key Considerations

Contracts for SaaS legal tech in this domain must extend beyond standard commercial agreements, incorporating robust safeguards and ethical mandates:

1.  **Data Protection & Confidentiality:**
    *   Strict adherence to regulations like GDPR, outlining security protocols, data minimization, purpose limitation, and clear policies for data retention and deletion.
    *   Safeguards against unauthorized access, use, sharing, destruction, or loss of sensitive data.

2.  **Survivor-Centric Design & "Safety by Design":**
    *   Mandate technology development with a survivor-centered approach, involving survivors and specialist practitioners to ensure genuine needs are met and new risks are mitigated.

3.  **Ethical Frameworks:**
    *   Inclusion of ethical guidelines addressing potential biases in AI, ensuring transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making, and prioritizing fairness.

4.  **Accessibility:**
    *   Requirements for accessibility to accommodate diverse user needs, including those with visual/cognitive impairments, and consideration for offline reporting.

5.  **Interoperability & Integration:**
    *   Provisions for seamless integration with existing systems used by support organizations, law enforcement, and legal aid providers.

6.  **Training & Support:**
    *   Comprehensive training and ongoing support for staff using the SaaS to ensure effective and safe utilization.

7.  **Incident Response & Breach Notification:**
    *   Clear protocols for data breaches, including timely notification to affected parties and regulatory bodies.

8.  **Compliance:**
    *   Assurance that the SaaS complies with all relevant legal and ethical standards pertaining to GBV support and legal services.

## Subscription Models: Key Considerations

Subscription models must be flexible, affordable, and sustainable, particularly for non-profit and charitable organizations:

1.  **Tiered Models:**
    *   Offer different tiers based on organization size, number of users, or feature requirements to ensure accessibility for a wide range of organizations.

2.  **"Freemium" or Grant-Funded Tiers:**
    *   Provide a basic free tier or models heavily subsidized by grants to enable smaller organizations or those with limited funding to access essential tools.

3.  **Flexible Pricing Structures:**
    *   Careful consideration of per-user or per-case pricing to avoid financial barriers; capped pricing or sliding scales could be beneficial.
    *   Organizational flat-rate subscriptions for predictability in budgeting.

4.  **Pilot Programs & Phased Rollouts:**
    *   Offer pilot programs with reduced costs for testing and feedback before full commitment, aligning with iterative development.

5.  **Value-Based Pricing:**
    *   Clearly demonstrate tangible benefits (e.g., efficiency in case management, improved evidence collection) to justify costs.

6.  **Transparency:**
    *   Maintain a transparent pricing structure with no hidden fees to build trust with organizations working with vulnerable populations.

## Conclusion
Both contractual agreements and pricing strategies must be deeply rooted in the unique context of GBV support, prioritizing the safety, privacy, and well-being of survivors and the operational needs of their supporting organizations.
