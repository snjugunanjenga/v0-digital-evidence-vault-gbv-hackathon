# Project Overview

## Introduction

The Digital Evidence Vault is a secure, web-based application designed to empower individuals, particularly survivors of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), to safely and immutably record digital evidence. The platform provides a secure chain of custody for digital files by allowing users to hash their evidence on the client-side, ensuring that the original files never leave their device. The generated hash, along with user-provided metadata, is then stored in a secure database and can be timestamped on the Hedera Consensus Service to create a tamper-proof, publicly verifiable record.

## Purpose & Goals

The primary purpose of the Digital Evidence Vault is to address the critical challenges survivors of GBV face when collecting and preserving digital evidence for legal proceedings. The goals of the project are to:

*   **Empower Survivors:** Provide a user-friendly tool for survivors to take control of their evidence without needing technical expertise.
*   **Ensure Data Integrity:** Guarantee the integrity of digital evidence through client-side hashing and immutable timestamping on a distributed ledger.
*   **Maintain Privacy:** Protect user privacy by never uploading the original, sensitive files to a central server.
*   **Establish Chain of Custody:** Create a verifiable and auditable chain of custody for digital evidence that can be used in legal contexts.
*   **Provide a Sustainable Service:** Establish a sustainable SaaS model to ensure the long-term availability and maintenance of the platform for NGOs, legal firms, and other organizations.

## Target Audience

The primary audience for this platform includes:

*   **Survivors of GBV:** Individuals who need a secure way to document and preserve evidence.
*   **NGOs and Support Organizations:** Groups that assist survivors and can use the platform to manage cases.
*   **Legal Professionals:** Lawyers and legal firms that require verifiable digital evidence for their cases.
*   **Human Rights Activists:** Individuals and organizations working to document and combat human rights abuses.
